			<h2>THE CHILDREN’S SCHOOL, STAMFORD, CT</h2>
			<p>Maryann Thompson Architects recently completed a new classroom building for a multi- disciplinary private school in Stamford. The school is conceived as a one-room schoolhouse, both linked by a diagonal view through the overlapping spaces of the classroom and divided by the structural lines of the beams overhead and the variegated exterior wall condition, which extends the spaces of the child’s world into the site. The two age groups of the school are housed in two classroom “wings,” both joined and separated by the entry area in which quiet activities are located to calm the child upon arrival. The variegated edge of the footprint helps to break down the scale of the building to make it in keeping with the scale of the child.</p>


			<br><h2>ATRIUM SCHOOL, WATERTOWN, MASSACHUSETTS</h2>
			<p>Atrium School looked to Maryann Thompson Architects to design its new home when the progressive K-8 program was forced to find new facilities. The project called for the adaptive re-use of an open warehouse structure on a limited site in a densely populated residential area. Because the parcel is long and narrow, it presents specific challenges to the arrangement of parking fields and green space and the movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic through the site. A satisfying resolution was achieved by rethinking the building’s orientation on the site. By creating an alternate entry sequence, the child approaches the school through a landscape garden rather than a highly trafficked street. We opened the warehouse with glazing that introduces ample daylighting and cross-ventilation. Dependency on daylight versus artificial light allows the child to experience the changing weather patterns and seasons on the building’s exterior. This project was completed within a restrictive design and construction time frame of under 10 months.</p>

			<br><h2>NEW MIDDLE SCHOOL FOR GIRLS AT THE CRANBROOK ACADEMY OF ART, BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MI</h2>
			<p>Maryann Thompson Architects was a finalist for an invited competition for the design of a girls' middle school at Cranbrook. Ideas central to the project involve referencing and respecting the horizontality of the beautiful existing Saarinen building to which the dormitory will be attached; bringing in as much light as possible into the classrooms; creating cozy spaces that will bridge the gap between the large scale of the building and the middle school girls; maintaining a transparency that will allow one to connect to the landscape and the genius loci of the place.</p>


			<br><h2>WOODLAND DORMITORIES, KENYON COLLEGE, GAMBIER, OHIO</h2>
			<p>Following a process of student involvement, historical analysis, and site analysis, Thompson and Rose developed a four-building dormitory complex surrounding a courtyard landscape. The neo- Gothic dormitories reflect the historic campus architecture. The project received the 1996 Tucker Award from the Building Stone Institute, the 1995 American Institute of Architects New England Honor Award for Design Excellence, and the 1994 Boston Society of Architects Design Award. The project was completed in December of 1993. It was published in the November 1994 issue of Architectural Record.</p>

			<br><h2>BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY CAMPUS CENTER, WALTHAM, MASSACHUSETTS</h2>
			<p>In 1999, Thompson and Rose Architects undertook the design of a new $22 million student center for Brandeis University which is still under construction. The 60,000-square-foot facility will house the university theater, a library, a café, and student service offices. The student center is envisioned as a vibrant, 24 hour building that will accommodate a variety of events including lectures, film, music and theater. The building will serve as the symbolic center for student life on campus.</p>

			<br><h2>THE COLORADO COLLEGE COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLAN, COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO</h2>
			<p>The Colorado College Master Plan is a comprehensive thirty-year master plan by Thompson and Rose that identifies, clarifies, and shapes a long-term vision for the campus. The plan responds to the academic program of the college and strengthens the overall unity of the campus. The process evoked support from the campus community, neighborhoods, and the greater Colorado Springs community. The plan now serves as a guide for campus improvements into the 21st century.</p>

			<br><h2>THE PUTNEY SCHOOL GYMNASIUM AND PERFORMING ARTS CENTER, PUTNEY, VERMONT</h2>
			<p>Thompson and Rose Architects completed the schematic design phase of a new performing arts center and a new athletic facility for the progressive southeast Vermont boarding school in 1999. The performing arts building includes a five-hundred-seat auditorium, a gallery, and a dance studio. A second building houses a 10,000-square-foot gymnasium with generous views of Putney’s landscape.</p>

			<br><h2>THE FOOTE SCHOOL, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT</h2>
			<p>This $5 million project in a leafy precinct of New Haven, by Thompson and Rose, includes a new art and music classroom building, an airy but intimate black box theater, and an expanded, renovated gymnasium overlooking the school’s playing fields. The buildings were conceived following an extensive process of student and faculty involvement. </p>


			<br><h2>CHILMARK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CHILMARK, MASSACHUSETTS</h2>
			<p>This elementary school, in Chilmark’s historic town center by Thompson and Rose creates a town green among the surrounding historic buildings and public spaces. Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates completed the Landscape Architecture design.</p>

			<br><h2>THE HARTSBROOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, HADLEY, MASSACHUSETTS</h2>
			<p>Completed in 1989 by Thompson and Rose, the Hartsbrook School is located on a spectacular site with dramatic views of the Holyoke Range. The Master Plan calls for ten buildings housing three pre-school classrooms and gardens; eight elementary school classrooms; and space for dining, assembly, music, crafts, woodworking, dance, and athletics, all oriented to the mountains and to the daily path of the sun. The architectural style reflects local indigenous traditions, in terms of scale and materials as well as the sculptural form of the immediate site. The Hartsbrook School has been published in Progressive Architecture, won the 1990 American Wood Honor Award, and was part of a traveling exhibition in Europe and the United States entitled "Organic Architecture: The New Expressionists", sponsored by the Iona Foundation of Switzerland. The design of the school and our process of community involvement are featured in the book School Design by Henry Sanoff.</p>

			<br><h2>CONNECTICUT COLLEGE ENTRY AND GATEHOUSE, NEW LONDON, CONNECTICUT</h2>
			<p>Thompson and Rose Architects designed a new main entrance to the Connecticut campus that reconfigures the approach to the campus. A gatehouse, driveway, landscape and lighting design augment arrival views of the campus.</p>

			<br><h2>CONNECTICUT COLLEGE MEMORIAL, NEW LONDON, CONNECTICUT</h2>
			<p>In conjunction with a local artist, Thompson and Rose Architects designed the Ad Astra Garden on the main lawn of Connecticut College to serve as a public gathering spot, and campus monument. The memorial overlooks views of the Long Island Sound and serves as a tribute to major donors. The project was completed in 1997.</p>
