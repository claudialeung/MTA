			<h1>Firm Description</h1>

			<p>Maryann Thompson Architects was founded by Maryann Thompson in October of 2000. Prior to that Maryann had been a senior/founding partner in the firm Thompson and Rose Architects.</p>


			<br><p>Maryann Thompson Architects is a Cambridge-based architecture firm that offers a wide range of services to public and private clients. We specialize in architecture that is sustainable, regionally driven and that attempts to heighten the phenomenological qualities of the site in which we work. Our architectural investigations revolve around such concerns as the creation of a rich and thoughtful edge between inside and outside, utilizing light as a medium, and employing warm, natural materials in order to accentuate a sense of place. Maryann received a 1998 AIA Young Architects Award, which states that although Maryann has been "...in practice for less than a decade, she has made a significant contribution to architecture. Her work reconnects architecture with the landscape and celebrates tectonics, materials and a poetic approach to design."</p>

			<br><p>The firm's staff of 15 comes from diverse backgrounds, including architecture, landscape architecture, green architecture, planning, interior design and the visual arts. Maryann Thompson Architects has LEED Accredited professionals on staff, and Maryann carries degrees in both architecture and landscape architecture, bringing to the practice an interdisciplinary approach where issues of the landscape are central to our design thinking. We believe in integrating planning, programming and design in a holistic, consensus-building approach to projects. Our projects range in scale from large institutional buildings to small-scale residential work.</p>
